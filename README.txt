Solidity Contracts are like a class in any other object-oriented programming language. 
They firmly contain data as state variables and functions which can modify these variables. 
When a function is called on a different instance (contract), 
the EVM function call happens and the context is switched in such a way that the state variables are inaccessible. 
A contract or its function needs to be called for anything to happen.

In this repo I'll be covering the basic properties of contracts such as constructors, state variables, variable modifiers, 
fuctions, creating a contract and much more.
